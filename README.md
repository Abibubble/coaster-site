This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This project is open for submissions for Hacktoberfest.

## Project requirements:

- Log in / out functionality
- Which coasters have been ridden by the user
- How many times the user has ridden each coaster
- Wish list of coasters the user wishes to ride
- Review functionality for each coaster and park
- Comment section for each coaster and park
- Coming Soon section for coasters that are currently being built
- List of all coasters, with the ability to sort
- List of all theme parks, with the ability to sort
- Search functionality
- Fully responsive for all devices
- List of top 10 or 20 coasters for each user
- Submission form for coasters not on the site

The frontend will be built using React.js and Next.js, and hosted on Vercel. This will also need a web scraper to scrape a list of coasters and add them to the database. No decision has been made about where the backend should be hosted.

Accessibility is a big focus on this project, as all users should be able to access the site, regardless of any accessibility requirements that they might have.
