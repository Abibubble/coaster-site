# Dependencies

## Updating

To check for outdated dependencies and start the automated update process, run the following command:

```bash
npm run dep:update
```

This will run [npm-check](https://www.npmjs.com/package/npm-check) and guide you through selecting and updating dependencies. Select all dependencies you want to update and then press enter to begin.

Once the updates have completed, ensure the updates have not negatively impacted the codebase and commit the changes to build a new version of the package.
