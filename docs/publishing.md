# Publishing

## Guidelines

Before publishing:

- Update all relevant documentation
- Only publish working, fully-featured code
  - Do not publish changes which break any existing code
- Mark breaking changes appropriately

Note: You can commit changes locally (including WIP commits) without pushing them. You can also create a branch to push these changes to, and raise a PR once the changes are complete and ready to be published.

## Process

1. Run the commit check command and fix any issues

```bash
npm run commit:check
```

2. Stage your changes
3. Commit your changes
4. Push your changes
